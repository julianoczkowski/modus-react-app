# Modus Accordion State Management - Short

Essential state management patterns for Modus Accordion components in React.

## Key Rules

- **Let Modus components manage their own state** - Don't try to control accordion state from React
- **Use `expanded` for initial state only** - Set initial state, then let component handle changes
- **Use `onExpandedChange` for tracking** - Monitor state changes without controlling them
- **Use refs for programmatic control** - Access component methods when needed
- **Avoid real-time synchronization** - Don't sync React state with accordion state
- **Handle events properly** - Use `onExpandedChange` to track state changes
- **Don't use `useEffect` for state sync** - Let components manage their own state
