# Development Workflow - Short

Essential linting and quality checks for React + Vite development.

## Key Rules

- **Fix violations before committing** - No violations in committed code
- **Check inline styles** - `npm run lint:styles` to catch inline style violations
- **Verify design system colors** - `npm run lint:colors` for color compliance
- **Validate Modus icons** - `npm run lint:icons` for icon usage
- **Check semantic HTML** - `npm run lint:semantic` for HTML compliance
- **Verify border usage** - `npm run lint:borders` for border compliance
