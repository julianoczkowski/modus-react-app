# Implementation Guides - Short

Create comprehensive implementation guides for major feature development.

## Key Rules

- **Create guides for major features** - Any feature requiring 2+ hours of development
- **Document before coding** - Plan architecture and approach first
- **Use required template sections** - Overview, architecture, plan, testing, deployment, documentation, review
- **Store in `.cursor/rules/implementation-guides/`** - Organized by feature name
- **Update status throughout development** - Planning → In Progress → Complete → Archived
- **Include post-implementation review** - Document lessons learned and improvements
- **Reference in commits** - Link to implementation guide in commit messages
